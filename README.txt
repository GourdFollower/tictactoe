Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!

Your options during this game are to play optimally and tie, or to throw the match and let the computer win.
It was an experiment for the author to implement the Minimax algorithm, and as such its UI is incredibly
bare-bones.

The squares of the board are numbered from 0 to 8, left to right, and descending. Unplayed squares
have a U on them. If you enter invalid input or attempt to play on a square which has already been played upon,
an error will be thrown.

Please allow some time at the beginning of the game for the computer to play; it has to build the game tree.

Future possible update: take advantage of board symmetry to simplify game tree.

Enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe.
